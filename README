IMP is largely available under the GNU Lesser GPL; see the file COPYING.LGPL
for the full text of this license. Some IMP modules are available under the
GNU GPL (see the file COPYING.GPL). Please refer to the documentation at
http://salilab.org/imp/doc.html for more detail.

Files under the build directory (even pure Python modules) are built from sources
elsewhere within IMP. Do not edit them there - any changes you make will be
overwritten! You should also not add any files to these directories, as they
will be deleted.

The lib directory contains Python modules (both pure Python, in the IMP
subdirectory, and C++ extensions, as _IMP_foo.so in the top-level directory)
and the IMP C++ libraries (as libimp_foo.so in the top-level directory).
Rationale: Windows searches for C++ dynamic libraries in the same directory
as C++ Python extensions.

The include directory contains all public header files under the IMP
subdirectory. Modules are in named subdirectories under that.

The swig directory contains all SWIG interface (.i) files used to build
the Python interface.
