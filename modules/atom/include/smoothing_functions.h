//! Base class for smoothing nonbonded interactions as a function of distance.
/** The class is given the score (and optionally its first derivative)
    at a given distance and returns a smoothed form of the score.
    Smoothing functions are used to avoid a discontinuity in the scoring
    function and/or its derivatives at the cutoff distance (the distance
    threshold used by IMP::core::ClosePairsFinder), as this can lead
    to nonphysical motions of the system. They are used by physical scoring
    functions that drop off slowly with distance, such as CoulombPairScore,
    in combination with a ClosePairsFinder.

    Smoothing functions usually offset the score by a constant value
    (a shift function) or smooth it from its normal value to zero over
    a defined range (a switch function, such as ForceSwitch).

//! Smooth interaction scores by switching the derivatives (force switch).
/** This function leaves the scores unaffected for distances below or equal
    to min_distance, returns zero for distances above max_distance, and between
    the two thresholds smoothes the score such that its first derivatives drop
    linearly, i.e. the score is simply multiplied by \f[
        \begin{cases}
            1 & d \leq d_{min} \\
            \frac{(d_{max} - d)^2 (d_{max} + 2d - 3d_{min})}
                 {(d_{max} - d_{min})^3} & d_{min} < d \leq d_{max} \\
            0 & d > d_{max}
        \end{cases}
    \f] where \f$d\f$ is the distance, and \f$d_{min}\f$ and \f$d_{max}\f$ are
    the thresholds set in the ForceSwitch constructor.

    This behavior is roughly equivalent to CHARMM's force switch nonbonded
    interaction smoothing (which is also the smoothing mechanism used
    by MODELLER).
