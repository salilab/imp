//! The topology of a complete CHARMM model.
/** This defines all of the segments (chains) in the model as
    CHARMMSegmentTopology objects, which in turn define the list of residues,
    the atoms in each residue, and their types and the connectivity
    between them.

    A CHARMMTopology object can be created manually, in which case add_segment()
    can be called to add individual CHARMMSegmentTopology objects. In this way
    a new topology can be created, e.g. from protein primary sequence.

    Alternatively, given an existing Hierarchy, e.g. as returned from
    read_pdb(), CHARMMParameters::create_topology() can be called to generate
    a new topology that corresponds to the primary sequence of the Hierarchy.

    A new topology can be patched (apply_default_patches() or
    CHARMMPatch::apply()) to modify the simple chain of residues to
    account for modified residues, C- or N-termini special cases, disulfide
    bridges, etc.

    Once a topology is created, it can be used to generate new particles
    which conform to that topology (create_hierarchy()), or to add
    topology information to an existing Hierarchy (e.g. add_atom_types(),
    add_bonds(), add_charges()).

  void add_atom_types(Hierarchy hierarchy) const;

  //! Add atom Cartesian coordinates to the given Hierarchy using this topology.
  /** The primary sequence of the Hierarchy must match that of the topology.

      This method can be used to add missing coordinates (e.g. of hydrogens
      or sidechains, such as those added by add_missing_atoms()), or to
      generate a starting conformation for a new Hierarchy (e.g. generated
      by create_hierarchy()). On exit, all atoms will have coordinates.

      - Cartesian coordinates for any atoms that are not currently core::XYZ
        particles are generated using internal coordinates that relate them
        to particles that do have XYZ coordinates.

      - For each segment (chain), if no atoms have coordinates but a triplet
        of atoms can be found where their internal distances and angle can be
        determined from internal coordinates, these three atoms will be
        placed to seed the generation procedure. For the first segment, the
        atoms will be placed on the xy plane with the first atom at the origin.
        For subsequent segments, the first atom is placed offset by (2.,2.,2.)
        from the last atom in the previous segment.

      - If any atoms cannot be placed using either method, their coordinates
        are assigned randomly to lie near atoms that are near in sequence or,
        if no such atoms exist, near the segment origin.

      \note It is valid to specify internal coordinates in a CHARMM topology
            file that leave the angles or distances unspecified. This function
            will attempt to fill in this missing information using CHARMM atom
            types and the parameter file. Thus, better results will be obtained
            if add_atom_types() is called before this function, and the
            CHARMMParameters object used contains parameter information.

      Parameters for the bonds (ideal bond length, force constant) are
      extracted from the CHARMM parameter file, using the types of each atom
      (add_atom_types() must be called first, or the particles otherwise
      manually typed using CHARMMAtom::set_charmm_type()).

      If no parameters are defined for a given bond, the bond is created
      with zero stiffness, such that the bond can still be excluded from
      nonbonded interactions but BondSingletonScore will not score it.

      Note that typically CHARMM defines bonds and impropers
      (see add_impropers()) but angles and dihedrals are auto-generated from
      the existing bond graph (see CHARMMParameters::create_angles() and
      CHARMMParameters::create_dihedrals()).

      The list of newly-created Bond particles can be passed to a
      StereochemistryPairFilter to exclude bonded particles from nonbonded
      interactions, or to a BondSingletonScore to score each bond.
