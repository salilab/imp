## \example atom/charmm_forcefield_verbose.py
# In this example, a PDB file is read in and scored using the CHARMM
# forcefield. It is similar to the 'charmm_forcefield.py' example, but fully
# works through each step of the procedure using lower-level IMP classes.
# This is useful if you want to customize the way in which the forcefield
# is applied.

# Score all of the bonds. This is done by combining IMP 'building blocks':
# - A ListSingletonContainer simply manages a list of the bond particles.
# - A BondSingletonScore, when given a bond particle, scores the bond by
#   calculating the distance between the two atoms it bonds, subtracting the
#   ideal value, and weighting the result by the bond's "stiffness", such that
#   an "ideal" bond scores zero, and bonds away from equilibrium score
#   non-zero. It then hands off to a UnaryFunction to actually penalize the
#   value. In this case, a Harmonic UnaryFunction is used with a mean of zero,
#   so that bond lengths are harmonically restrained.
# - A SingletonsRestraint simply goes through each of the bonds in the
#   container and scores each one in turn.

# in an angle or dihedral (1-3 or 1-4 interaction). Then, a
