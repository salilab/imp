## \example atom/molecular_hierarchy.py
# In this example, we read a protein from a PDB file and set the center and
# radius of each residue to enclose the atoms in that residue.
#
# Then a second copy of the protein is loaded and they are both added to the
# same hierarchy to define a hypothetical assembly.
