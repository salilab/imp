/** \page idock_progs Integrative docking utility programs

The integrative docking protocol includes a number of tools:

\section saxs_score_bin saxs_score
Scoring with SAXS profile.
<pre>
Usage: \<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> \<exp_profile_file\>
saxs_score program scores results of docking of two molecules against the SAXS profile file.

\<pdb1\> - The first molecule that was given to docking program and was kept in place during docking
\<pdb2\> - The second molecule that was given to docking program and was transformed
\<trans_file\> - Docking output file with transformations that bring the transformed molecule to the static molecule.
  The format is as follows:

    1 -0.75020 0.67870 0.34160 82.62000 59.28000 -1.01100
    2 -0.42560 0.55540 0.33110 75.69000 67.15000 -0.30480
    3 -0.48910 0.66950 0.11820 84.94000 58.97000 3.34300

  The first number is the transformation number followed by three rotational and three translational parameters.

\<exp_profile_file\> - The SAXS profile of the complex. see https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/foxs/help for format details.
</pre>


\section em2d_score_bin em2d_score
Scoring with EM 2D class averages.
<pre>
Usage: \<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> \<image1\> \<image2\>...
em2d_score program scores results of docking of two molecules against 2D class averages from EM.

\<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> as above
\<image1\> \<image2\>... - complex 2D class averages in PGM format (P2)
</pre>

\section em3d_score_bin em3d_score
Scoring with EM 3D density map.
<pre>
Usage: \<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> \<em_map\>
em3d_score program scores results of docking of two molecules against 3D density map.

\<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> as above
\<em_map\> - density map of the complex in mrc format
</pre>


\section nmr_rtc_score_bin nmr_rtc_score
Scoring with NMR residue type content term (NMR-RTC).
<pre>
Usage: \<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> \<residue_content_file1\> \<residue_content_file2\>
nmr_rtc_score program scores results of docking of two molecules against NMR residue type content.
NMR residue type content data provides us with information about residue composition at the interface.
For example, we can know that the interface has 2 arginine and 3 histidine residues.

\<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> as above
\<residue_content_file1\> - residue content file for pdb1 or '-' if none
\<residue_content_file2\> - residue content file for pdb2 or '-' if none
  The format of the file is as follows:

MET 0
ARG 0
HIS 2

  This would correspond to having 0 methionine, 0 arginine and two histidine residues in the interface.
</pre>

\section cross_links_score_bin cross_links_score
Scoring with cross links detected by mass spectrometry.
<pre>
Usage: \<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> \<cross_links_file\>
cross_links_score program scores results of docking of two molecules against cross linking dataset.

\<pdb1\> \<pdb2\> \<trans_file\> as above
\<cross_links_file\> - file with detected cross links

  The format of the file is as follows:
145 - 1 A 3 27
224 - 1 A 3 27
169 - 1 A 3 27
222 - 1 A 3 27

Each line corresponds to one cross link. Each cross link is defined by residue numbers and chain ids of the cross linked residues, followed by limits on the distance between CA atoms.

'145 - 1 A 3 27' corresponds to a cross link between residue 145 in a chain with blank chain id and residue 1 in chain A. The minimal distance is 3A and the maximal is 27A.
</pre>

\section combine_scores_bin combine_scores
Combine scores for different data types.
<pre>
Usage: combine_scores \<file1\> \<weight1\> \<file2\> \<weight2\> \<file3\> \<weight3\>...
combines files with same docking transformations in the following format:

# | score | filtered (+/-) | z-score | ... | Transformation

The programs for scoring of docking transformations (saxs_score, em2d_score, em3d_score, nmr_rtc_score) output results in this format.
</pre>
Only filtered values of + are combined. The output score is the weighted sum of Z-Scores.

\section recompute_zscore_bin recompute_zscore
Recompute z-scores for combined scores.

\section em3d_single_score_bin em3d_single_score
Score a single model with EM3D.

\section em2d_single_score_bin em2d_single_score
Score a single model with EM2D.

\section soap_score_bin soap_score
Score models with SOAP.

\section cross_links_single_score_bin cross_links_single_score
Score a single model with cross links.

\section interface_cross_links_bin interface_cross_links
Generate cross links for an interface.

\section interface_rtc_bin interface_rtc
Generate residue content for an interface.
