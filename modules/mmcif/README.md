\brief Support for output of models in mmCIF format.

This module adds basic support for outputing IMP models in mmCIF format,
using the [integrative/hybrid modeling extensions](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHM-dictionary).
This allows IMP models to be deposited in [PDB-dev](https://pdb-dev.wwpdb.org/).

Note that this module is still under heavy development, and not yet
completely functional.
