/** Lloyd's algorithm with random restarts.
Each run is broken into trails, we keep to prefrom trails as long as we improve
the global distortion. The first failed trail ( a trail in which we could not
improve the total distortion) finalized the run as well. Each trail is broekn
into few lloyd stages.
A run starts by sampling center points at random.
Each run is provided two parameters, a maximum number
of runs per stage (maxRunStage) and a minimum accumulated
relative distortion loss (minAccumRDL).  If the accumulated RDL
for the run exceeds this value, then the run ends in success.
If the number of stages is exceeded before this happens, the run
ends in failure.
