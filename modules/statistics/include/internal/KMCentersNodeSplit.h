/** Splitting nodes contain a cutting dimension and a cutting value. These
    indicate the axis-parellel plane which subdivide the box for this node.
    The extent of the bounding box along the cutting dimension is maintained
    (this is used to speed up point to box distance calculations) [we do not
    store the entire bounding box since this may be wasteful of space in
    high dimensions]. We also store pointers to the 2 children.

      with the left and right subtrees, respectively. We sample from the left
      subtree with probability (2mL-1)/(2m-1) and sample from the right subtree
      with probability (2mR-1)/(2m-1).

      The rationale is that, assuming there is exactly one point per leaf node,
      a subtree with m points has exactly 2m-1 total nodes. (This should be
      true for this implementation, but it depends in general on the fact that
      there is exactly one point per leaf node.) Hence, the root should be
      sampled with probability 1/(2m-1), and the subtrees should be sampled
      with the given probabilities.
