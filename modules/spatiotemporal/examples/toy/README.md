# Spatialtemporal scoring in IMP
Tutorial for scoring a spatiotemporal model using our spatiotemporal package. We assume that static structural models have already been generated, following existing procedures (https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/actin/).

The jupyter notebook (Simple_spatiotemporal_example.ipynb) walks through the basics of using the create_DAG function, including the necessary and optional inputs, and how to interpret the resulting model.
