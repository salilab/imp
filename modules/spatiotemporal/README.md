# Spatialtemporal scoring in IMP
Here, we describe the spatiotemporal modeling package. The goal of this package is to read in a variety of input data and convert this data into a weighted graph of states. In the following, we go through each script, along with the functions available.

## create_DAG.py

### create_DAG(state_dict,input_dir='', scorestr='_scores.log', output_dir='',spatio_temporal_rule=False, subcomplexstr='.config',expected_subcomplexes=[],score_comp=False, exp_comp_map={},out_cdf=True, out_labeled_pdf=True, out_pdf=False, npaths=0,draw_dag=True)
This functions streamlines the process of creating a graph by performing all the necessary steps and saving relevant input to files. Features of this function are walked through in example/toy/Simple_spatiotemporal_example.ipynb

#### Possible inputs:

#### Inputs related to model input / calculation
state_dict - dictionary that defines the spatiotemporal model. They keys are strings that correspond to each time point in the stepwise temporal process.
Keys should be ordered according to the steps in the spatiotemporal process. The values are integers that correspond to the number of possible states at that timepoint.
Scores for each model are expected to be stored as state_timescorestr,
where state are integers 1->value of the dictionary, time is the key in the dictionary, and
scorestr is trailing characters, which are assumed to be constant for all states.

input_dir - string, directory where the data is stored. Empty string assumes current working directory.

scorestr - string, trailing characters at the end of the file with scores for each stage of the spatiotemporal model (default: '_scores.log').

output_dir - string, directory where the output will be written. Empty string assumes the same directory as the input_dir.

#### Inputs related to spatiotemporal scoring (all optional)
spatio_temporal_rule- Boolean. If true, enforces that all components earlier in the assembly process are present later in the process. (default: False)

subcomplexstr- string, trailing characters after the subcomplex file, which is a list of subcomplexes included in the given label/time (default: '.config')

expected_subcomplexes- list of all possible subcomplex strings in the model (default: []) Should be a list without duplicates of all components in the subcomplex files.

#### Inputs related to composition scores (all optional)
score_comp - Boolean to determine whether or not to score models based on the protein composition

exp_comp_map - dictionary for determining protein composition score. The keys are the proteins. The code checks if the name of these proteins are within the subcomplex_components for each node. As such, the naming scheme should be such that the keys of exp_comp_map are substrings of expected_subcomplexes the values of exp_comp_map should correspond to a csv file for each subcomplex with protein copy numbers. Each csv file should have 3 columns:
1) 'Time' - should correspond to the keys of state_dict, 2) 'mean' - mean copy number from experimental data, and 3) std - standard deviation from experimental data

#### Inputs related to model output (all optional)
out_cdf - Boolean to determine whether or not to write out the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the graph (default: True)

out_labeled_pdf - Boolean to determine whether to output the labeled pdf file, which includes both the pdf and the ordered states visited along each path (default: True).

labeled_pdf_fn - string, name of the file for the labeled pdf (default: 'labeled_pdf.txt')

out_pdf - Boolean to determine whether or not to write out the probability distribution function (pdf) for the graph (default: False)

npaths - int, write out the states along the n most likely paths, based on the pdf (default: 0)

draw_dag - Boolean to determine whether or not to write out a directed acyclic graph (dag) to a file (default: True)

scores - list of floats, mean scores based on priors and likelihoods used for modeling

time - string, describes the time of the node

index - int, unique numbering for each node

label - int, numbering for each node that starts at 1 at each time point. This will correspond to the number in the input data

components - List of proteins/subcomplexes in this particular node. Must be a subset of expected_subcomplexes

## composition_scoring.py

Returns the nodes, with the new weights added.

nodes - list of graphNode objects, which have been already been initiated with static scores

exp_comp_map - dictionary, which describes protein stoicheometery. The key describes the protein, which should correspond to names within the expected_subcomplexes. Only copy numbers for proteins or subcomplexes included in this dictionary will be scored. For each of these proteins, a csv file should be provided with protein copy number data. The csv file should have 3 columns, 1) "Time", which matches up to the possible times in the graph, 2) "mean", the average protein copy number at that time point from experiment, and 3) "std", the standard deviation of that protein copy number from experiment.

exp_comp_map - dictionary, which describes protein stoicheometery. The key describes the protein, which should correspond to names within the expected_subcomplexes. Only copy numbers for proteins
or subcomplexes included in this dictionary will be scored. For each of these proteins, a csv file should be provided with protein copy number data. The csv file should have 3 columns,
1) "Time", which matches up to the possible times in the graph, 2) "mean", the average protein copy number at that time point from experiment, and 3) "std", the standard deviation of that protein copy number from experiment.

t - string, time at which the composition likelihood should be calculated. Should match one a possible value in the first column of the exp_comp_map.

state - list of integers, an array of the number of protein copy numbers for which the likelihood will be calculated. This array should list the proteins in the same order as the exp_comp_map.

## score_graph.py

### get_graph_as_dict(nodes):

## prepare_protein_library.py

### prepare_protein_library(times, exp_comp_map, expected_subcomplexes, nmodels, template_topology='', template_dict={}, match_final_state=True)
Function that reads in experimental stoicheometery data and calculates which compositions and location assignments should be sampled for spatiotemporal modeling, which are saved as config files. Optionally, a PMI topology file can be provided, in which case topology files for each composition and location assignment are also written.
The output is 3 types of files: 1. *_time.config - configuration files, which list the proteins included at each time point for each model 2. time.txt - protein copy number files. Each row is a protein copy number state and each column is the protein copy number in that state. Note that each protein copy number state can result in multiple location assignments. 3. *_time_topol.txt - topology files for each copy number and location assignment.

times - list of strings, the times at which the stoicheometery data should be read.

exp_comp_map - dictionary, which describes protein stoicheometery. The key describes the protein, which should correspond to names within the expected_subcomplexes. Only copy numbers for proteins or subcomplexes included in this dictionary will be scored. For each of these proteins, a csv file should be provided with protein copy number data.

The values (list) are the names of all proteins in the topology file that should have the same copy number as the labeled protein, specifically the "molecule_name." (default: {}, no topology files are output)

match_final_state: Boolean, determines whether to fix the final state to the state defined by expected_subcomplexes. True enforces this match and thus ensures that the final time has only one state. (default: True)
