    "# Example of spatiotemporal integrative modeling\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will assume that data suggests the assembly proceeds as a monomer->dimer->trimer, and that the data for these states was collected at set time points, namely 0 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes. Based on these assumptions, our model can be present in 6 possible states at 3 time points (2 states at 0 minues, 3 states at 5 minutes, and 2 states at 10 minutes), as summarized in the image below:\n",

    "\n",
    "For each of these combinations of proteins A and B, we would generate integrative models of each complex, following procedures such as those in modeling the Actin complex (https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/actin/). We will assume that this process was already done. The scores of each model were saved as *_scores.log and the stoicheometery for each model is described by *.config.\n",
