//! Fast scoring of Particles against electron microscopy class averages
/**
   The restraint fits the particles into the 2D images by alignment of
   principal components of each of the particles' projections with
   principal components of the 2D class average. Therefore, the
   particle set should comprise all subunits that are in the
   image. The aligned projections are scored against 2D class averages
   using the cross correlation score. This is a fast alignment and score
   that works well for negative stain EM class averages.
