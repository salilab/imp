/* Notes on directors and reference counting:

All reference-counted IMP C++ classes should also be managed correctly by the
SWIG interface. When an IMP class is created in Python, three objects are
created:
1. The IMP C++ object itself.
2. A low-level SWIG Python object created using the Python C API, which
   contains little more than a pointer to the IMP C++ object. This object
   calls IMP::internal::ref() and IMP::internal::unref() on the IMP C++ object
   at construction and when it is garbage collected.
3. A pure Python (proxy) object, which holds a Python reference to the low-level
   C API object.
Since all of these pointers are reference counted, the C++ object will be kept
alive as long as the Python proxy exists, and will be cleaned up when both the
proxy disappears *and* no C++ references to it exist. There is nothing,
however, to prevent a proxy object and the low-level SWIG Python object from
disappearing. (This is fine because such objects only wrap functionality in
the C++ objects anyway, and in fact we usually use Python to create C++
objects, then pass them to C++ containers, after which we *want* the Python
proxies to disappear, so as not to litter memory with the things. A new proxy
can be recreated when needed to access the C++ object.)

When directors are used, the situation is similar, except that the C++ object
is not the original IMP class, but a SWIG subclass that takes care of
delegating C++ method calls to the corresponding Python object. This includes
a weak pointer to the Python object. The pure Python class is now a
user-defined subclass of the proxy which holds implementations. So now it is
a problem if the proxy is destroyed, because then the C++ object cannot route
method calls to it. Thus, the proxy must be kept alive as long as the C++
object is. This could be achieved by maintaining a strong pointer from the C++
object to the Python object, but that would create a reference loop, and the
object would never be freed. Ideally the Python object's reference count would
be increased or decreased when the C++ object's count was, but this would
require some major surgery to the C++ base classes (virtual method calls for
every ref/unref, for example, which could hurt performance).

The simple solution implemented here is to add a Python reference for every
director object created, to keep it alive. These references are then cleaned
up periodically by inspecting the real C++ and Python reference counts.
For small numbers of director objects (our expected usage) this works well.
