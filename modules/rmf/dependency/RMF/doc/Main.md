# RMF #

The library provides support for the [RMF file format](\ref format) for
storing hierarchical molecular data (such as atomic or coarse grained
representations of proteins), along with markup, including geometry
and score data.

The RMF source code is available [on github](https://github.com/salilab/rmf/).
It can be built standalone, although it is generally used as part of
[IMP](https://integrativemodeling.org).

See
- [Installation](\ref installation) for information on obtaining and installing RMF.
- [RMF viewers](\ref viewing) for more information about viewing RMF files,
- [RMF file format](\ref format) for more information about the files,
- [RMF Library](\ref library) for more information about using the library.
- [Mapping data into RMF files](\ref mapping) for more information about how to structure data in RMF files.
