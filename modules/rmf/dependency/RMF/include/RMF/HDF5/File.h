  /** We provide a simple set of classes for accessing core HDF5 functionality
      from C++. This was needed since
      - The HDF5 C interface is not trivial to use properly, particularly in
      regards to data type conversions and resource management
      - It is very easy to use the C interface incorrectly without knowing it.
      - The
      \external{https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/, standard HDF5 C++ interface}
      doesn't really simplify use of the HDF5 library and doesn't make use
      of the features of C++.

      The main classes provide access too:
      - HDF5 files through RMF::File and RMF::HDF5::ConstFile
      - HDF5 groups through RMF::Group and RMF::HDF5::ConstGroup
      - HDF5 data sets through RMF::DataSetD and RMF::HDF5::ConstDataSetD

      The \c Const variants are for read only files.

      They allow one to create a manipulate data sets containing floating point
      values, integers, strings, variable length arrays of floating point values
      and a few other types. Attributes on data sets of groups of those types
      can also be manipulated.

      The top level classes are, in turn, derived from RMF::Object,
      RMF::HDF5::ConstAttributes and RMF::HDF5::MutableAttributes which provide
      access to general HDF5 per-object and attribute functionality (all objects
      in HDF5 can have arbitrary small pieces of data attached to them via
      attributes).

      Not all of the functionality of the HDF5 \c C library is covered in C++.
      You can get the corresponding native handle from most objects with methods
      like RMF::File::get_handle() and use that for other operations if needed.
      Or submit a patch to the library.
