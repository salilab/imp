/** Create a pairwise statistical potential from a file. The Keys passed
    as a template argument are used to determine how to map the names of
    the types as described in the loaded file to indexes. That is, if
    atom::ResidueKey is passed as the Keys, the potential will expect a file
    which has one line for each pair of residue names.

    The expected file format is:
\verbatim
    bin_width number_a number_b [offset]
    key_0a key_0b bin0 bin1 bin2...
    key_1a key_1b bin0 bin1 bin2...
\endverbatim

    The order of the lines (after the first one) does not matter.
    The bin_width is how much distance is allocated per bin (the distance used
    is that between the points). number_a and number_b are the numbers of
    particle types (number_b should only be specified if BIPARTITE is set).

    \note The values read in the file are for bins. That is, the first bin
    is from offset to offset+width. The second is offset+width to offset+
    2width.
    As a result, when interpolation is used, the function achieves the
    bin value at the center of the bin.

    \param[in] Key is an IMP::Key which maps between names and indices
    \param[in] BIPARTITE If true, the two sets of particles being stored are
    different (e.g. a protein atom and a ligand atom), otherwise they are
    assumed to both be the same. Appropriate values must be provided
    in the file.
    \param[in] INTERPOLATE If true, even the scores without derivatives are
    spline interpolated. If false, only the evaluation of derivatives is
    interpolated with a spline.
