\brief Functionality for handling multi-state models.

These are used in IMP to
model systems that are found simultaneously in multiple states. For example,
a hinge protein may be found in both 'open' and 'closed' forms, and so some
experiments conducted on a sample of the protein will return data from both
forms. Building a single model that tries to be consistent with all the data
will therefore fail - two models need to be constructed.

# multi_foxs {#multi_foxs_bin}
Command line tool to enumerate multi-state models with SAXS profiles.
See also IMP::foxs for the similar FoXS command line tool.

# multi_foxs_combination {#multi_foxs_combination_bin}
Command line tool to enumerate additions (such as glycans or ions) to a model with SAXS profiles.
See also IMP::foxs for the similar FoXS command line tool.
