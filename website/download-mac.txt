<h2>IMP 1.0 Mac installer</h2>

<p>
Two Mac binary installers are currently available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://salilab.org/imp/get.php?pkg=1.0/download/IMP-1.0-10v4.dmg">Intel Mac, OS X 10.4 (Tiger) installer (32-bit, Python 2.3)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://salilab.org/imp/get.php?pkg=1.0/download/IMP-1.0-10v6.dmg">Intel Mac, OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) installer (64-bit, Python 2.6)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to run IMP on a different type of Mac (e.g. a PowerPC system)
you will have to <a href="download.html#source">rebuild it from source</a>.</p>

<h2>Signature</h2>

<p>Please check the installer package against the
<a href="http://salilab.org/imp/1.0/download/md5sum">MD5SUM</a> file
to make sure it has not been tampered with (open a Terminal window, change
into the directory where you downloaded the .dmg file, run
"<tt>md5 foo.dmg</tt>" where <tt>foo.dmg</tt> is the name of the file
you downloaded, and compare the output to the content of the MD5SUM file.)

<p>
The MD5SUM file in turn
<a href="http://salilab.org/imp/1.0/download/md5sum.asc">is signed</a> with
<a href="http://salilab.org/~ben/pubkey.asc">this GPG key</a>; you can check
to make sure this has also not been tampered with using the
<a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">GnuPG</a> software.
</p>

<h2>Installation and getting started</h2>

<p>The installer will install IMP in the <tt>/usr/local/</tt> directory
on your Mac.</p>

<p>The IMP Python libraries are automatically set up to run with the default
version of Python on your Mac. To run an IMP Python script called
<tt>foo.py</tt>, simply run <tt>python foo.py</tt> from a Terminal window
in the directory containing the script. (If you have multiple versions of
Python installed on your system, you may need to force use of the default
system version by typing <tt>/usr/bin/python</tt> rather than just
<tt>python</tt>.)</p>

<p>Note that the IMP Mac package does not currently include the
'foxs' command line tool for small angle X-ray (SAXS) fitting. This will be
remedied in a future IMP release.
For now, please <a href="http://salilab.org/foxs">use the web interface</a>
or install IMP on a Linux machine.</p>
