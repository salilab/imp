This manual covers the installation of the Integrative Modeling Platform (%IMP)
software and its basic usage. It is targeted mainly at _users_, i.e. people
that want to use existing %IMP functionality. Later sections of this manual
introduce more technical details to those that want to modify the
%IMP source code to develop new methods (_developers_). The
[Reference Guide](../ref/) may also be useful for such developers.

Users that want to get started quickly with modeling a real biological
complex might want to skip ahead to
[Modeling of complexes using IMP::pmi](@ref rnapolii_stalk).

\note This documentation is for version IMPVERSION of %IMP. For documentation for other versions, please see the [documentation page at the IMP website](https://integrativemodeling.org/doc.html).
