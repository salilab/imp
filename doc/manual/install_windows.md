Building from source code on Windows {#install_windows}
====================================

We build and test %IMP on
Windows, built with the Microsoft Visual Studio compilers (we use Visual Studio
Express 2010 SP1 for the 32-bit Windows `.exe` installer, and
VS Express 2012 for the 64-bit `.exe` installer; for the
[Anaconda packages](https://integrativemodeling.org/download-anaconda.html),
both 32-bit and 64-bit,
we use VS 2008 SP1 for Python 2.7 and VS 2015 for Python 3.5).
One complication is that different packages are compiled
with different versions of Visual Studio, and mixing the different runtimes
(`msvc*.dll`) can cause odd behavior; therefore, we recommend building most
of the dependencies from source code using the same version of Visual Studio
that you're going to use to build %IMP.

We recommend building within the Anaconda environment, since many of the
dependencies are already built, and the procedure is scripted so it is more
easily reproducible:

  - Install the right version of Microsoft Visual Studio Express (it is free,
    but registration with Microsoft is required). Current Anaconda policy is
    to build packages using the same version of Visual Studio that was used
    to build Python. This means VS 2008 for Python 2.7 and VS 2015 for
    Python 3.5, for example.
  - Get and install [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) or the
    full Anaconda environment.
  - Install necessary conda packages for development:
    `conda install conda-build unxutils`
  - Then for each package `foo` you can start a Visual Studio command prompt,
    `cd` to the directory above the `foo` directory containing the
    [conda build recipe](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/recipe.html)
    then build it with
    `conda build --python=2.7 foo`
  - Feel free to refer to
    [our conda recipes](https://github.com/salilab/conda-recipes)
    for IMP and all needed dependencies. In particular, each recipe contains
    a `meta.yaml` file that applies any needed patches to make things work
    on Windows, and a `bld.bat` file that automates the build itself.

If you want to build outside of the Anaconda environment, the basic procedure
we employed is as follows:

  - Install Microsoft Visual Studio Express (it is free, but registration with
    Microsoft is required).
  - Get and install [cmake](http://www.cmake.org).
  - Get [Python](http://www.python.org)
    (make sure you get the
    32-bit version if you're going to build %IMP for 32-bit Windows).
  - Get and install the
    [zlib package](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm)
    (both the "complete package, except sources" and the "sources" installers).
     - The package without sources can be installed anywhere; we chose the
       default location of `C:\Program Files\GnuWin32`. The sources, however,
       must be installed in a path that doesn't contain spaces (otherwise the
       Boost build will fail). We chose `C:\zlib`.
     - We found that the zconf.h header included with zlib erroneously includes
       unistd.h, which doesn't exist on Windows, so we commented out that line
       (in both packages).
  - Download the [Boost source code](http://www.boost.org)
    (we extracted it into `C:\Program Files\boost_1_53_0`), then
     - Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt, and cd into the directory where
       Boost was extracted
     - Run bootstrap.bat
     - You may need to help the compiler find the zlib header file with
       `set INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\include`
     - Run `bjam link=shared runtime-link=shared -sNO_ZLIB=0 -sZLIB_SOURCE=C:\zlib\1.2.3\zlib-1.2.3`
  - Get and install [SWIG for Windows](http://www.swig.org)
  - Get the [HDF5 source code](http://www.hdfgroup.org)
     - Make a 'build' subdirectory, then run from a command prompt in
       that subdirectory something similar to
       `cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 10" -DHDF5_ENABLE_SZIP_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF -DHDF5_ENABLE_Z_LIB_SUPPORT:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_BUILD_HL_LIB:BOOL=ON -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\include" -DZLIB_LIBRARY="C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\lib\zlib.lib" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON ..`
     - Open the resulting HDF5 solution file in Visual Studio, change to
       Release configuration, then build the hdf5 project.
  - (Optional) [Build CGAL from source code](http://www.cgal.org/windows_installation.html).
  - (Optional) Download the
    [FFTW DLLs](http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html) and follow the
    instructions at that website to make .lib import libraries needed for
    Visual Studio.
     - Copy `libfftw3-3.lib` to `fftw3.lib` to help cmake find it
  - (Optional) Get the
    [GSL source code](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm)
    and build it:
     - Open the libgsl project file in the `src\gsl\1.8\gsl-1.8\VC8`
       subdirectory
     - Build in Release-DLL configuration
     - Copy the generated `libgsl.dll` and `libgslcblas.dll` to a suitable
       location (we used `C:\Program Files\gsl-1.8\lib`)
     - Copy the corresponding .lib files, libgsl_dll.lib and libgslcblas_dll.lib
       (we recommend removing the _dll suffix and the lib prefix when you do
       this so that cmake has an easier time finding them, i.e. call them
       gsl.lib and gslcblas.lib).
  - (Optional) Get [numpy and scipy](http://www.scipy.org) to match your
    Python version.
  - (Optional) Get and install
    [libTAU](https://integrativemodeling.org/libTAU.html)
     - Copy `libTAU.lib` to `TAU.lib` to help cmake find it.
  - (Optional) Get the [OpenCV source code](http://opencv.org/)
    and build it by [following these instructions](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html)
     - Copy each `opencv_*.lib` to a similar file without the version extension
       (e.g. copy `opencv_ml244.lib` to `opencv_ml.lib`) to help cmake find it
  - Set PATH, INCLUDE, and/or LIB environment variables so that the compiler
    can find all of the dependencies. (We wrote a little batch file.)
  - Set up %IMP by running something similar to

     `cmake <imp_source_directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="/DBOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK /EHsc /D_HDF5USEDLL_ /DH5_BUILT_AS_DYNAMIC_LIB /DWIN32 /DGSL_DLL" -G "NMake Makefiles"`

  - Note: you may need to add `/bigobj` to `CMAKE_CXX_CFLAGS`, particularly
    if building for 64-bit Windows.
  - Then use simply 'nmake' (instead of 'make', as on Linux or Mac) to
    build %IMP. (cmake can also generate Visual Studio project files, but
    we recommend nmake.)
  - To use %IMP or run tests, first run the `setup_environment.bat` file to set
    up the environment so all the programs and Python modules can be found.
    (This batch file needs to be run only once, not for each test.)
