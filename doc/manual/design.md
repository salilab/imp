Design of %IMP {#design}
==============

The Integrative Modeling Platform (%IMP) software implements the
integrative modeling procedure [described above](@ref procedure).
Integrative modeling
problems vary in size and scope, and thus %IMP offers a great deal of
flexibility and several abstraction levels as part of a multi-tiered
platform:

The next parts of the manual will cover the use of the various parts of
%IMP, starting from the simplest:

 - [Chimera(X) tools/web services](@ref web_services):
   we provide a number of web services that
   use %IMP at [https://salilab.org/](https://salilab.org). Additionally,
   the [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) and
   [UCSF ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) packages include
   several tools that use %IMP. These are the simplest to use because they
   do not require an %IMP installation.

 - [Domain-specific applications](@ref cmdline):
   we provide a number of command-line tools, designed to be used by %IMP
   users with no programming experience, that provide user-friendly
   applications to handle specific tasks, such as fitting of proteins into
   a density map of their assembly, or comparing a structure with the
   corresponding SAXS profile.

 - [PMI](@ref rnapolii_stalk):
   the _Python Modeling Interface_ (PMI) is a powerful set of tools designed
   to handle all [steps of the modeling protocol](@ref procedure) for
   typical modeling problems. It is designed to be used by writing a set of
   Python scripts.

 - [IMP C++/Python library](@ref library_intro): at the lowest level,
   %IMP provides building blocks and tools to allow methods developers to
   convert data from new experimental methods into spatial restraints,
   to implement optimization and analysis techniques, and to implement an
   integrative modeling procedure from scratch; the developer can use the
   C++ and Python programming languages to achieve these tasks.
