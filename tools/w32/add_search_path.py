"""Patch IMP, ihm and RMF SWIG wrappers to search for Python extensions and DLLs
   in Python version-specific directories. These directories are created by
   the .exe Windows installers, and are not in the standard Python search
   path, so need to be added. We need to patch IMP/__init__.py so we add
   paths before any usage of any IMP module, and RMF.py too in case RMF
   is imported before IMP.

   Note that we used to simply use the 'patch' utility to do this, but the
   SWIG folks changed the header of their output files, which confused patch.
   Instead, we look for import lines, and add our code after the first block
   of imports (which import standard Python modules such as 'sys').
   This ensures that the search path is properly set up before we try to
   import IMP/ihm/RMF extensions, but doesn't come before the comment header
   or any __future__ imports (which must come first).
