Description: The Integrative Modeling Platform
  IMP's broad goal is to contribute to a comprehensive structural
  characterization of biomolecules ranging in size and complexity from small
  peptides to large macromolecular assemblies. Detailed structural
  characterization of assemblies is generally impossible by any single existing
  experimental or computational method. This barrier can be overcome by hybrid
  approaches that integrate data from diverse biochemical and biophysical
  experiments (eg, x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy,
  immuno-electron microscopy, footprinting, chemical cross-linking, FRET
  spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, immunoprecipitation, genetic
  interactions, etc...).
  .
  We formulate the hybrid approach to structure determination as an optimization
  problem, the solution of which requires three main components:
    * the representation of the assembly,
    * the scoring function and
    * the optimization method.
  .
  The ensemble of solutions to the optimization problem embodies the most
  accurate structural characterization given the available information.
  .
  We created IMP, the Integrative Modeling Platform, to make it easier to
  implement such an integrative approach to structural and dynamics problems.
  IMP is designed to allow mixing and matching of existing modeling components
  as well as easy addition of new functionality.
