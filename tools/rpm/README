This directory contains files to build RPM packages for RedHat Linux and
similar systems (we have tested it on current versions of RHEL and Fedora,
but it may work on other RPM-based Linux variants).

To use, simply copy IMP.spec.in or IMP-copr.spec.in to IMP.spec and replace
@IMP_VERSION@ with your IMP version number:

IMP.spec.in tries to build as much of IMP as possible into an RPM that will
install on plain Fedora (or RHEL with the EPEL repository). At build time
extra RPM dependencies may be needed from
https://integrativemodeling.org/build-extras/ but these libraries will be
bundled into the final IMP RPM so will not be needed at run time.

IMP-copr.spec.in builds everything except the IMP.cnmultifit module (which
requires the closed-source libTAU library). It does not bundle any
dependencies, which will be needed both at build time and run time from Fedora
COPR at https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/salilab/salilab/.
This spec file is used to build the IMP package itself in COPR.
