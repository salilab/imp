# Note that RHEL 5 doesn't have a new enough swig to build IMP. If you must
# use RHEL 5 (we recommend RHEL 6) you will need to build a newer SWIG package
# before building IMP.
BuildRequires: scons >= 0.98, boost-devel >= 1.33, swig >= 1.3.40
BuildRequires: python-devel >= 2.3, gsl-devel, hdf5-devel, fftw-devel
# You can safely comment out this line if you don't have Modeller;
# IMP will simply build without the IMP.modeller module.
BuildRequires: modeller

# RHEL doesn't have a CGAL package, so build without CGAL on RHEL. It also
# doesn't have a new enough OpenCV in EPEL, or the eigen package, so
# disable em2d and isd modules.
# on Fedora, all of these packages are available; add them as dependencies

# If you are using RHEL and really want the isd module, add
# '-D "rhel_have_eigen3 1"' to your rpmbuild invocation. You will need to
# build and install your own eigen3-devel RPM first (get the RPM spec and
# patch files from http://svn.salilab.org/imp/trunk/tools/rpm/).
# IMP binary RPMs are built this way, since eigen3 is header only and so
# this adds no extra dependencies to the binary package.

%description
IMP's broad goal is to contribute to a comprehensive structural
characterization of biomolecules ranging in size and complexity from small
peptides to large macromolecular assemblies. Detailed structural
characterization of assemblies is generally impossible by any single existing
experimental or computational method. This barrier can be overcome by hybrid
approaches that integrate data from diverse biochemical and biophysical
experiments (eg, x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy,
immuno-electron microscopy, footprinting, chemical cross-linking, FRET
spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, immunoprecipitation, genetic
interactions, etc...).

We formulate the hybrid approach to structure determination as an optimization
problem, the solution of which requires three main components:
    * the representation of the assembly,
    * the scoring function and
    * the optimization method.

The ensemble of solutions to the optimization problem embodies the most
accurate structural characterization given the available information.

We created IMP, the Integrative Modeling Platform, to make it easier to
implement such an integrative approach to structural and dynamics problems.
IMP is designed to allow mixing and matching of existing modeling components
as well as easy addition of new functionality.
