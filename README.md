Building IMP from source code
=============================

To build IMP source found in `path/to/imp-source` and install it in
`path_to_install` do:

1. `mkdir build && cd build`
2. `cmake path/to/imp-source -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install`
3. `make -j4`
4. `make install`

See the [installation instructions in the manual](https://integrativemodeling.org/nightly/doc/manual/installation.html)
for more details (in particular this covers the necessary prerequisites you'll
need before running cmake).

Run `ccmake` to see more variables that can be used to customize your build and
install.

To run IMP without installing, build IMP and then use `setup_environment.sh` to
set the required environment variables. For example, to run `ligand_score`, do
`./setup_environment.sh ligand_score arguments...`, or
`./setup_environment.sh $SHELL` and then `ligand_score arguments...` in the
new shell.

Files and folders structure
===========================

When you build IMP, the `lib` directory contains Python modules (both pure
Python, in the `IMP` subdirectory, and C++ extensions, as `_IMP_foo.so`
in the top-level directory) and the IMP C++ libraries (as `libimp_foo.so`
in the top-level directory). Rationale: Windows searches for C++ dynamic
libraries in the same directory as C++ Python extensions.

The `include` directory contains all public header files under the `IMP`
subdirectory. Modules are in named subdirectories under that.

The `swig` directory contains all SWIG interface (`.i`) files used to build
the Python interface.
